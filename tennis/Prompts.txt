I would like to create database for my rackets.

There is csv file in the FischerList folder. Each line corresponds to a single racket. 
Convert this to Microsoft SQL database. Each racket may contain several images. 
In the example there is link to one image, that are found in the Fischerlist folder. 

I am now connected Azure subscription to VS Code. 
Now I want to create database that has structure of the csvfile FischerList/FischerList_Cleaned.csv

I do not have the database, How to create it?

Now I have created fischertennis database successfully.

Each racket may contain several images. In the example 
there is link to one image, that are found in the Fischerlist folder.

I need to change the OwnedByTommi from VARCHAR(255) to integer in database

I want to to create web page that displays a slidehow. 
Slideshow images are read from the files as in test_db2.py. 
Use only images that has OwnedByTommi >= 0. 

Rackets in the database use \ instead of / in the directory listing (ImagePath). I want to replace all \ to /.

My code /home/tmatila/anaconda3/envs/cv2/bin/python/home/tmatila/repos/ai_academy/Tennis/run_html.py 
runs okay, but the web page cannot find my images for display.

The code works with modifications. Now I want to modify it so that there is three html-pages. One "Tommi's rackets" shows Rackets WHERE OwnedByTommi > 0, second "Desired by Tommi" Rackets WHERE TommiWantsThis = '1', third page "Whole database" all Rackets. The selection between is done using buttons in the top of the web page. 

Make the background grey with some texture. Also make the buttons wide, so that they cover the whole screen width.
